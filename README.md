# sparrow
A static site generator (project from boot.dev)

Currently doesn't support nested delimiters, but I will implement it in the future.

## Usage
- Have Python 13.2+ installed
- Use the example template.html or modify it for your personal needs (only the {{ Title }} and {{ Content }} will be changed)
- Use the example index.css or modify it for your personal needs
- Write your Markdown inside the 'content' folder
- Run ```./main.sh``` in your terminal
- If you don't have permission to run it, then run ```chmod +x main.sh```
